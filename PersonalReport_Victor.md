I actually began studying at CCT in September 2021. While the course was challenging, I enjoyed the content and my fellow students. Unfortunately, due to a personal loss in November 2021, I had to pause the course after completing one of the four required classes.

In September 2022, I returned to the course with some prior knowledge of the pitfalls I had encountered in the previous year's Strategy Thinking project. Last year, my group struggled with organisation, but I had higher hopes for my 2022 group. Despite facing various limitations and constraints, we were able to maintain a constructive and engaged team dynamic.

One critical aspect of the project was the selection of the dataset and project theme. Given the limited room for changes once the project was underway, it was important to make a wise choice. When I learned about the 3W Dataset from Petrobras in the Brazilian media, I saw an opportunity to investigate and present it to my group. Although the group initially approached the idea skeptically - which was very understandable - we ultimately decided to pursue it. I took on the main responsibility for understanding and analysing the data.

Despite the full-time commitments and various personal challenges faced by group members, we were able to stay committed to the project and course. We used various tools, such as Slack, Google Meet, and Github, to stay connected and collaborate.

I am proud of our project choice and the resulting report, and believe we have laid a strong foundation for next semester. The data understanding section exceeded my expectations, as my recent knowledge from other classes proved to be invaluable.

Looking ahead, I hope we can continue to build on this project and develop a well-structured and effective model. While I have a professional background in coding, the challenges of this field extend far beyond programming. However, I find these challenges to be exciting and am confident that pursuing this career is what I want.
